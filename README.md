# Ngo-management-system
Software to store all the NGO activities online .Built with python GUI.

The broad features of the system are listed below:

● The NGO has a list of poor students registered who have sought their help. For each student the NGO maintains his/her age, class, school in which they are studying, parental income and kind of help provided by the NGO (like books, money, school dress etc.)

● The NGO has an estimate of the amount of money needed for the books, dress, fees for different classes. Therefore it can get an estimate of the funds it needs to continue its operations.

● The NGO maintains the track record of the performance of the students and in case of insufficient funds priority is given to brighter students, girls and low parental income (a suitable measure needed).

● The NGO maintains a list of donors who have pledged to help them with the amount of money pledged. The donors can register for the NGO and can enter the amount they intend to contribute. The donors can also choose if they wish to donate annually / semi-annually. Therefore whenever the NGO is in need of funds they check the list and contact the donors for money.

● The NGO also accepts other donations like books, dress, shoes, bags etc. and maintains an inventory for these items. Every year it checks how many items it has for the students so that there is not a need to buy them this year.
